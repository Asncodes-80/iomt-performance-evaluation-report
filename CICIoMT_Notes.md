Why they have a lot of effort to develop comprehensive IoMT security dataset and
named it CICIoMT for developers or any medical IoMT device producers? 

The effort to develop the comprehensive IoMT security dataset, named
CICIoMT2024, aims to address existing gaps in IoMT security research by
providing a realistic benchmark for evaluating and developing security
solutions. It offers a diverse range of device behaviors, attack scenarios, and
protocols, which are essential for researchers and developers to create
effective cybersecurity measures tailored to the unique challenges of healthcare
environments. This dataset ultimately supports the advancement of secure IoMT
device deployment, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
medical services.

Can you tell me about attack scenarios and attack protocols?

Attack scenarios refer to specific situations or methods in which cyberattacks
are executed against IoMT devices, illustrating how attackers might exploit
vulnerabilities. Examples include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks,
where multiple compromised devices overwhelm a target, or Man-in-the-Middle
attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between devices.

Attack protocols are the communication standards or methods used during these
attacks, such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for messaging in
IoMT environments, TCP/IP for network communication, or ARP (Address Resolution
Protocol) for local network interactions. Understanding both scenarios and
protocols is crucial for developing effective security measures against
potential threats in IoMT systems.

What is the main motivation of this research?

The main motivation of this research is to address the limitations of existing
datasets and networking data processing pipelines in the context of medical
security, specifically for IoMT devices. By creating a realistic benchmark
dataset, the research aims to enable the development and evaluation of effective
IoMT security solutions, enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of
healthcare systems. This effort seeks to support researchers in investigating
new mechanisms and improving the security of IoMT operations against various
cyber threats.

## Notes:

The complexity and data volume of IoMT network traffic requires advance methods
to enhance security and reliability.

Machine Learning offers techniques to detect, prevent, and mitigate
cyberattacks.

## Gaps

Existing benchmark datasets lack essential features for robust iomt security
solutions, such as reduced number of real devices, a limited variety of attack,
and a lack of extensive profiling.

## Protocols

+ Wi-Fi
+ MQTT
+ Bluetooth

## As their goal

1. Aiding researchers in creating secure heAlthcare systems using ML.
2. Beyond simulating attacks, we capture the lifecycle of IoMT devices from
network entry to exit through profiling, allowing classifiers to identify device
anomalies.
3. Their results as CICIoMT2024 release into CI dataset page, demonstrates that
various methods can classify IoMT cyberattacks.

## Importance of IoMT

IoT devices present a limited pool of computational resources compared to
traditional systems. This is a key factor to observe in terms of the device
security, their simpler network profiles these components bring to the network
(limited pool of protocols), and the possible open doors for attackers.

For instance, iot devices can be exploited in Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
as key vectors. there is a current lack of standards for iot devices. for
example, the NIST maintains a repo for the vulnerability management of several
devices called the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). [nvd ref](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

Vulnerabilities discovered that can affect devices in use are shared in this
database to enable the general public to be aware and patch their systems. In
iot, devices are diverse and present multiple brands, firmware, and purposes.

Although there are some initiatives to create standard repo for iot, this
diversity makes it difficult for vulnerabilities to be tracked and patched for
all devices.

The main issue refers to the increase of iot as an important asset in many envs
as well as a main target for attackers.

All of theses benefits and cybersecurity concerns also apply to healthcare
applications. 

Some iot devices are not widely adopted in specific envs for instance, infusion
pumps are devices adopted in healthcare and unavailable in other envs
vulnerabilities.

For example, iot devices have been targeted in many ransomware attacks against
healthcare orgs in the past few years. In fact, security solutions need to
consider this aspect to different area of healthcare.

+ In terms of confidentiality, sensitive patient's information may be disclosed.
+ In terms of integrity, vital readings can be manipulated to compromise the
accuracy of the treatments provided.
+ In terms of availability, attacks may disrupt critical services and lead the
operations to un safe states.

In the context of IoMT, the primary security concerns comprise Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of safety critical applications.

Given the complexity and amount of data generated by iot and iomt network
traffic, advanced methods have become especially useful in these envs. In this
context, ML brings various techniques and solutions that can improve the
detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyber-attacks.

By analyzing the networking patterns in a multidimensional space, ML can
identify anomalies in the network, abnormal iomt traffic, and characteristics of
attacks that can be launched (DDoS).

ML can enable the automated detection of potential threats and help healthcare
professionals deliver high-quality services with a continuous security
monitoring approach.

A temp sensor can be implemented to send temp readings once a day. At the same
time, an aircraft sensor can be implemented to send structural readings
regularly. Alongside the temporal differences, iot services can also rely on
multiple protocols like MQTT, which can include specific patterns in the network
traffic.

Similarly, IoMT devices can operate differently depending on the app. for
example the traffic generated by an infusion pump is usually less frequent than
continuous physiological monitor. These differences can be learned or captured
by ML techniques to identify if abnormal traffic is sent through the network.

CICDataset contains some data. What's these data? Is it a bunch of data about
some medical devices network traffic to learn anomaly or noises data?

Although there are some datasets available for the development of security apps
in iomt, there are important features not addressed in the current
state-of-the-art contributions. for example operational diversity is a critical
aspect to consider to mimic a realistic iomt environment.

To mimic a healthcare iomt infrastructure, a topology needs rely on the use of
multiple services that would naturally adopt different protocols (Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, and MQTT).

The CICIoMT2024 brings a novel processing pipeline that enables data processing
for multiple protocols.

The main contributions of this research are:
+ **Development of a Comprehensive IoMT Security Dataset:** includes 18
different cyberattacks against a diverse set of 40 IoMT devs, Also this contains
research protocols namely Wi-Fi, MQTT, and Bluetooth protocols.
+ **Innovative methodology in iomt attack simulation and data collection:** A
novel systematic approach to simulating and capturing iomt network traffic under
various cyberattack scenarios. Considering the complex network of healthcare
including DDoS, DoS, Recon, MQTT, and spoofing, using a combination of real and
simulated devices. They provide advance network monitoring techniques and
specialized hardware, such as network taps, ensure the high fidelity of data
collection (Fidelity in the context of data science refers to the accuracy and
precision of data representations and analyses. It is a critical concept that
determines how closely a model or dataset reflects the real-world phenomena it
aims to represent
[refs](https://statisticseasily.com/glossario/what-is-fidelity-in-data-science-explained/)).
+ **Profiling iomt device lifecycle for enhanced security understanding:** This
research captures the lifecycle of these devices in different vital phases of a
device from the moment they join the network until they leave. As mobility in
healthcare organizations is considered a regular practice, profiling the
lifecycle while encompassing various operational phases like power interaction,
idle, active and interaction states becomes very important. by this research we
will learn understanding of the devices behavioral patterns by meticulously
capturing and analyzing the behavior of IoMT devices from the moment they join
the network. this research critical in identifying and mitigating potential
security vulnerabilities.
+ Multi-dimensional Evaluation: This study not only benchmarks the current state
of ML in IoMT security but also opens avenues for future exploration in
algorithm optimization and feature engineering.

**IoMT plays a critical role in medication management, wellness tracking, and
alert systems.**

IoMT enables remote care, personalized treatments, and preventive measures.

New applications are begin developed using IoMT devices in healthcare. These
solutions aim to improve the medical practice by offering comfort, remote care,
higher accuracy, and interconnection.

Windows Laptop). Concerning the attacks launched, the authors focus on scaling,
ARP Spoofing, DoS, Smart, and injection.

NOTE: Moreover, other IoT security datasets are not necessarily focused on
healthcare applications.

Note from CIC IoT Lab:

Establishing an IoT lab with several devices is difficult for many reasons. Such
devices require supporting network devices (e.g., routers, access points, and
switches) to connect and a team capable of setting up all the configurations
needed. Furthermore, purchasing these devices at scale requires planning and
financial investments that are not readily available. The Canadian Institute for
Cybersecurity (CIC) has invested in establishing a well-equipped IoT lab. This
investment comprises the acquisition of tens of IoT devices for multiple
purposes (e.g., healthcare devices, home automation devices, and next-generation
devices), several supporting network systems (e.g., routers, switches, access
points, servers, adapters, sniffers, and networks taps), IoT kits (e.g., Arduino
and Raspberry Pi’s), and miscellaneous devices. A technical team is dedicated to
maintaining and managing the current IoT devices, network, and inventory while
analyzing new IoT devices that can be purchased and included in our topology.

The CICIoMT2024 comprises the use of several devices and multiple purposes. Fig.
3 illustrates the devices used alongside the network segregation. The main goal
of this topology is to simplify the process of capturing network traffic from
different protocols while mimicking realistic operations. Also, devices are
separated based on the protocol used to enable protocol-specific attacks to.

An iPad acts as a remote controller for several devices across the network. This
iPad and four Raspberry Pi’s are connected to an access point. In this case, the
Raspberry Pi is a malicious device that launches all attacks. Then, this access
point is connected to a Netgear switch, which gives access to the IoMT devices
as well as to the Internet provider. This Internet connection is essential since
many IoMT devices need to connect to remote servers.
